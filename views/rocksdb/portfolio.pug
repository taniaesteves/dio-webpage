                    | RocksDB issued more than 500 million storage system calls, most of which were <code>pread64</code> syscalls (91%).
                    | <br>Besides the <code>pread64</code> syscall, RocksDB also issued <code>write</code>, <code>close</code>, <code>openat</code>, and <code>read</code> system calls.
                    | <br>Moreover, the RocksDB application spawned 2 processes and 33 threads, and accessed more than <code>15,000</code> different file paths.

                    | When multiple background threads (<code>rocksdb:high0</code> and <code>rocksdb:lowX</code>) submit I/O requests, the number of syscalls of <code>db_bench</code> threads descreases.
                    | <br>On the other hand, when fewer background threads execute simultaneosly, the performance of <code>db_bench</code> threads improves.
