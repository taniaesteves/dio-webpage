                p
                    | Elasticsearch issued about 1 million storage system calls, most of which were <code>write</code> system calls (71%).
                    | <br>Besides the <code>write</code> operations, Elasticsearch also issued <code>pread64</code>, <code>read</code>, <code>lseek</code>, <code>stat</code>, <code>fdatasync</code>, <code>pwrite64</code>, <code>fstat</code>, <code>openat</code>, <code>lstat</code>, <code>close</code> and other operations.
                    | <br>Moreover, the Elasticsearch application spawned 42 processes and 118 threads, and accessed almost 4000 different file paths.

                    | The system call with the highest average execution time was <code>fsync</code>, which took <code>2.99</code> milliseconds on average.
                    | <br><code>fdatasync</code> was the second most expensive system call, with an average execution time of <code>2.46</code> milliseconds.
                    | <br>The average execution time of the <code>unlink</code> system call was <code>0.36</code> milliseconds.

                    | Elasticsearch accessed two types of files: <code>regular files</code> and <code>directories</code>.
                    | <br>The majority of the system calls were issued to <code>regular files</code> (about 1 million).

                    | Some files exhibit a constant access pattern, even in the absence of client requests.
                    | <br>Every <code>30</code> seconds Elasticsearch submits at least <code>2</code> system calls to the <code>node.lock</code> file (blue line).
                    | <br>Every <code>2</code> minutes, Elasticsearch submits <code>9</code> system calls to <code>.es_temp_file</code> file (pink line).

            .specExplanation
                p
                    | Elasticsearch always performs the same sequecence of system calls:
                    | <code>lstat→openat→write→openat→fsync→close→close→lstat→unlink</code>.
                    | <br>The system call with higher execution time is <code>fsync</code> (blue bar).
                    | <br>There is a duplication of <code>openat</code> and <code>close</code> system calls.
