    h5 Diagnosis
    p
        | Using DIO to analyze the application execution, we obtained the following information (see Figure 1):
        ul
            li
                | The client program (<code>app</code>) starts by creating the <code>app.log</code> file, writing <code>26</code> bytes starting from offset <code>0</code>, and closing the file (
                span.blackcircle 1
                |).
            li
                | Then, Fluent Bit (<code>fluent-bit</code>) detects content modification at the file, opens it, and reads <code>26</code> bytes from offset <code>0</code>, which means that <code>fluent-bit</code> processes the full content previously written by <code>app</code> (
                span.blackcircle 2
                |).
            li
                | Later, <code>app</code> removes the file with the <code>unlink</code> sytem call(
                span.blackcircle 3
                |).
            li
                | <code>app</code> then creates a new file with the same name as the previous one (<code>app.log</code>) and writes <code>16</code> bytes to it (
                span.blackcircle 4
                |).
            li
                | <code>fluent-bit</code> opens the new log file for reading its content, but instead of reading from offset <code>0</code>, as expected, it starts reading at offset <code>26</code> (
                span.blackcircle 5
                |).
            li
                | By starting at the wrong offset, the <code>read</code> sytem call returns <code>zero</code> bytes and <strong>the 16 bytes written by <code>app</code> are lost</strong>.

    h5 Explanation
    p
        | When a file is removed, the operating system releases the associated inode number (<code>12</code>), which can later be attributed to a new file.
        | However, a possible scenario is this inode number being mapped to a newly created file with the same name.
        | This is what happens in this case, as the inode number of the file <code>app.log</code> is reused for the new file created by <code>app</code>.
    p
        | Before reading a file, Fluent Bit updates the file position to the number of bytes already processed.
        | This value is kept on a database for each tracked file, identified by its name plus inode number.
        | Erroneously, database entries are not deleted when files are removed at the file system.
        | Therefore, since the same file name (<code>app.log</code>) and inode number (<code>12</code>) are attributed to the newly created file, <code>fluent-bit</code> erroneously assumes that the first <code>26</code> bytes of the latter log file were already processed.


    //- p
    //-     | <strong>Solution</strong>: As suggested in the Pull Request for the issue, this inefficient I/O pattern can be fixed by:
    //-     ul
    //-         li keeping the log's file descriptor opened while the file is being used, and
    //-         li using <code>writev</code> to write log lines more efficiently.

    //- p
    //-     | <strong>Validation</strong>: Using DIO, we are also able to validate the proposed solution by observing the new access pattern for the log file.
    //-     With the suggested fix redundant <code>open</code> and <code>close</code> operations are avoided, along with the need for using <code>lseek</code> before every write operation. Also, <code>writev</code> is now used to write log lines, instead of <code>write</code>.
