                    | The <code>app</code> command creates the app.log file, writes 26 bytes to offset 0 and closes it.
                    | <br>Fluent Bit opens the app.log file and reads the 26 bytes from offset 0.
                    | <br><code>app</code> then removes the file and creates a new one with the same name, to which it writes 16 bytes at <code>offset 0</code>.
                    | <br>Fluent Bit opens the new app.log file and attempts to read from <code>offset 26</code>, which returns 0.
